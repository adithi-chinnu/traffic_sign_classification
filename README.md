## Overview

This project aims to classify traffic signs into various categories using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of different traffic signs and is capable of predicting the class of a given traffic sign image.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, you should have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning Framework)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Any additional libraries as specified in the code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-sign-classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd traffic-sign-classification
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install tensorflow numpy
   ```

4. Pre-trained Model

   If you have a pre-trained model, you can place it in a directory and load it as shown in the code snippets. Make sure to update the model loading code to the correct path.

5. Data

   Ensure you have the dataset of traffic sign images. If not, download it from a reliable source or use your own dataset. You may need to preprocess the data to be suitable for the model. Update the data loading code accordingly.

6. Predict Traffic Signs

   You can predict the class of a traffic sign using the code snippet below:

   ```python
   y_pred = model.predict(test_images)
   predicted_classes = y_pred.argmax(axis=-1)
   predicted_label_index = predicted_classes[0]  # Change the index if needed
   predicted_label = all_labels[predicted_label_index]
   print("Predicted label: ", predicted_label)
   ```

   This code snippet loads an image of a traffic sign and predicts its class.

## Model Evaluation

You can evaluate the model using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, depending on your requirements. Metrics can be calculated by comparing the predicted labels to the true labels of the test dataset.

## Training

If you need to train your own model, you can use a code snippet similar to the one provided earlier in your Python script. Ensure that you have the training dataset and labels properly prepared.
